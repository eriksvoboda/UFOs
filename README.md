# UFOs

## Purpose of Project

The purpose of this project is to take the dynamic table that was previously built and allow users to filter for multiple criteria. We also eliminate the filter button and update the project to search for the criteria based on when info is input into the fields.

## How to use the Search

In order to use the new search capabilities, first begin by entering a value into one of the five fields.
